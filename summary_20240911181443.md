Here's the rewritten text:

Bishop Charles Fran√ßois-Bienvenu Myriel lived in 1815. He was 75 years old and had been a bishop since 1806. When he first arrived, people started talking about him. What people say about someone can affect their life, even if it's not true.

M. Myriel was born into a family of lawyers. His dad wanted him to take over his job, so he arranged a marriage for him when he was just 18 or 20. People said M. Myriel was handsome and liked to have fun. But when the revolution came, his family was forced to leave France, and his wife died in Italy. They didn't have any children.

After that, something changed in M. Myriel. Maybe seeing all the tragedy and loss made him want to leave his old life behind. Maybe he had a kind of spiritual awakening. Whatever it was, when he came back from Italy, he was a priest.

I hope that helps!
