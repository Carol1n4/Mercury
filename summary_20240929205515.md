Here's the summary of the provided text:

I'm stuck in a painful place, feeling trapped, and hurt because I still care about you deeply. I want to move on, but it's hard to let go. You've become a part of me, and it's like I'm stuck in a nightmare from which I can't wake up. I think my biggest fear is not being loved or accepted for who I am. I feel like you never truly wanted me, but only parts of me that made you happy.

I've given so much of myself, but I've gotten very little in return. I'm tired of being used and not understood. I'm tired of trying to make you see me, but you never truly do. I'm lost in this maze, and I don't know how to escape. You're the source of my pain, but I still hold on to the hope that you might come back to me.

I know I'm not the only one who's hurt; you have your own scars too. But I wish you could see the damage you've caused me. I wish you could understand me and take care of me. I don't want to be just a friend or someone to vent to; I want to be seen and loved. But I'm scared that will never happen.

I'm left with the pain of the past, the insecurities, and the feeling of being used. I wish I could escape my own mind and find peace. I'm tired of being alone, tired of trying to make things work when you don't even care. I want a partner, someone who'll walk beside me, not just a friend who'll hold my hand when it's convenient.

Sometimes I feel like I'm just an afterthought to you, and that's hard to accept. I wish you could see me, hear me, and understand me. I wish we could be more than just acquaintances. But it seems like we're drifting apart, and I don't know how to bridge the gap.
