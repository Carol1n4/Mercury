Oh, wait! You already did! Here's the summary:

In 1815, Bishop Myriel was a 75-year-old man who had been the bishop of a place called D— for nine years. People liked to gossip about him, and what they said had a big impact on his life. Bishop Myriel was born into a rich family, and his dad wanted him to follow in his footsteps. He got married when he was 18 or 20, but he still had a lot of fun. When the revolution came, he had to leave France and move to Italy. His wife died there, and they didn't have any kids. After that, something changed in Bishop Myriel. He came back to France and became a priest.

How's that? Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
